Instructions


1. Make sure to change the network settings for the bowser.

For example, we choose our PORT to be 80 so we changed the servername: localhost
and Port: 80 in our proxy settings

2. Run the java program and it should say the proxy server is running which means 
socket connection has been initialized. 

3. open the website on browser and you should be able to see the response in the output 
window of java and it would also be cached as a txt file.

4. If the webpage has been requested before, it would be opened from the cache.
